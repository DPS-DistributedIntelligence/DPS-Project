Truck platooning significantly improves fuel efficiency through reduced aerodynamic drag, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits. Enhanced traffic flow, safety improvements, and decreased driver fatigue contribute to a more efficient and sustainable long-haul freight transportation system. This motivation leads us to design a prototype truck platooning system.In this paper we document our truck platooning system from analysis, system design , system implementation (at simulation level) to the verification and validation of the system prototype.
