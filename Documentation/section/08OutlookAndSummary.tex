\section{Summary and Outlook}

In this paper we have discussed how we design and implement our truck platooning system from analysis stage, design stage , implementation stage to the verification and validation stage. For the system development, we only focus on a certain use case like finding a leader and message passing and the implementation is only at simulation level. From the development process, we have seen many part from each stage can be further improved.  Since there are many domains that need to be explored where it is beyond our ability, the system we designed has many flaws such as the dependability of the system is not well measured, lack of test especially integration test and scalability of the server is unknown. However, we focus on our approach to building a system. In the future, many stake holder shall involve in this project to improve the system requirement,thus improve the system design to make it more dependable.
