The platooning system consists of mainly two components: the truck, which can either be a leader or a follower, and the communication channel. The following block definition diagram is shown in Figure \ref{img:system_bdd}, which represents various system components and their relationships in a truck platooning system. There are two main subsystems: the instance of the truck and the server. The truck consists of other subsystems such as the controller unit, communication unit, collision avoidance unit, and human-machine interface. This portioning allowed us to develop the system prototype more efficiently because two parts could be developed in parallel. The upcoming section provides a detailed explanation of specific parts of the system and their functionalities.
