## Leander

> ### Communication
> Implementation of a server like to simulate the communication to a leader truck, so follower truck may be able to communicate with each other.

> Workload:
> - [x] Server
> - [x] Client

## Mykyta

> ### Communication
> Implementation of a server like to simulate the communication to a leader truck, so follower truck may be able to communicate with each other.

> Workload:
> - [ ] Task 1
> > - [x] Task 1.1
> > - [ ] Task 1.2 

## Sheikh

> ### Truck / Controller
> Implementation of the Truck ecosystem, the truck will be able to be a LEADER or a FOLLOWER depending on the scenario.
> Implementaiton of the internal state machine, creating the scenarios for a truck to be a leader or a follower.
> Implementation of a thread system to have a concurrent system.

> Workload:
> - [x] State Machine.
> > - [x] Optimization of the state machine. 
> - [x] Threads.
> - [x] Client optimization to avoid print multiple messages
